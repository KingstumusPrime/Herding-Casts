# Herding Casts

This game was created for the [Brackys 2022.2]([https://kingstimusprime.itch.io/herding-casts](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-8/rate/1680678)) game jam in one week using Pygame.

## Looking Back

This project has been left in its original state intentionally, bugs and all. Since this project was a huge learning experience, I wanted to revisit it years later and go over what I learned. I remember spending the first few days grinding Pygame tutorials to get a basic idea of how it works (this can be found in game.py). After that, I came up with this idea to use minimal art inspired by [this](https://www.the-sun.com/lifestyle/624749/can-you-guess-the-tv-film-characters-from-their-block-versions/) article. I remember the biggest struggle with this game was not actually making it (though I had a couple struggles here) but instead building it. I had realized at 10:30 at night that I had no clue how to have others run it on their machines. After trying for hours to port it to an .exe and failing, I submitted the source code as a zip and called it a night. This explains the build and dist folders inside of the project. All in all, this project placed 785th, but it taught me one of the biggest lessons in software development: "A finished project with a good user experience will do much better than a complex one that's impossible to use." The game was definitely too big for me at the time, but then again, this was never about winning or publishing a game; if I wanted that, I would have used a game engine. Instead, it was about getting some sort of finished project, and it pushed my programming limits.

## Building

Building this game is by far its biggest flaw. I tried to clean up the build a little bit, but you still may need to run "pip install" for the necessary packages.
